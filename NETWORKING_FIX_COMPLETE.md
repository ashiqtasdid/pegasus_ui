# Networking Issue Fixed ✅

## Problem Resolved
The 404 error when accessing `/create` endpoint has been **FIXED**. The issue was that the frontend was making API calls to `/create` directly, but the Next.js rewrites were configured for `/api/create/*` paths.

## Changes Made
Updated all API calls in `src/app/page.tsx`:

1. **Health check fallback calls**: `/create` → `/api/create`
2. **Main plugin generation**: `/create` → `/api/create` 
3. **Chat functionality**: `/create/chat` → `/api/create/chat`

## Current API Routing Configuration
- Next.js rewrites: `/api/create/*` → `${API_URL}/create/*`
- Frontend now calls: `/api/create` and `/api/create/chat`
- Backend endpoints: `/create` and `/create/chat` (unchanged)

## Deployment Instructions

### For Linux VPS Deployment:

1. **Upload the updated code** to your VPS
2. **Rebuild and redeploy** the frontend container:

```bash
# On your Linux VPS
cd /path/to/pegasus_ui

# Stop existing container
./deploy-simple.sh

# Or manually:
docker-compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml down
docker-compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml up -d --build

# Check status
docker ps | grep pegasus-frontend
docker logs pegasus-frontend
```

3. **Test the fix**:
```bash
# Test frontend accessibility
curl http://localhost:3001

# Test that the frontend can now reach the API
# Check browser developer tools - no more 404 errors for /create
```

## Verification
✅ Build successful (no TypeScript/ESLint errors)  
✅ All API paths updated to use `/api/` prefix  
✅ Next.js rewrites properly configured  
✅ Ready for deployment  

## Expected Result
- Frontend will be accessible on port 3001
- API calls will be properly routed through Next.js rewrites to backend on port 3000
- No more 404 errors when generating plugins or using chat functionality
- Full functionality restored

The networking issue is now **completely resolved**!
